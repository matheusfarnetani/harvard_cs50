What is Git?

1. Keep track of changes to code

2. Syncronizes code between different people.

3. Test changes to code without losing the original.

4. Revert back to old versions of code.


Commands

git clone <url>
    -   makes a copy of a repository
    -   stores it on your copmuter
    -   a "fork" creates your own copy of someone
        else's repository.

git add <filename>
    -   adds a file to "staging area"
    -   tells git to include the file in the next
        revision to the repository

    -   git aff * adds all changed files

git commit -m "message"
    -   saves the changes to repository as a new
        revision (a "commit")
    
    -   records a message
    -   git commit -am "message" adds and commits
        in the same step

git dif
    -   shows every tracked changes

git status 
    -   shows current status of repository

git push

        git push origin master

            reverts code back to a previous commit
    -   git reset --hard origin/master
            reverts code back to remote repository version


Branching
    -   Branch is a version of the repository
    -   Each branc has its own commit history and current version.

    git branch
        -   shows all branches of code
        -   create a branch with git branch <branch_name>
        -   switch to ("checkout") a new branch with
            git checkout <branch_name>
        -   git checkout -b <branch_name> 
                to checkout and create new branch
    
    git merge
        -   git merge <branch_name> merges the branch
            branch_name with current branch

    git branch -D <branch_name>

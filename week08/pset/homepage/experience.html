          In this internship I worked with the development of residential, commercial and
          industrial architectural projects, using tools such as AutoCad, Revit, Archicad,
          Sketchup, V-Ray, Photoshop, Illustrator and Indesign. Contributing to all the stages
          that involve the process of a construction, from measurements of previously existing
          elements, through the stages of preparation of the preliminary project, legal project
          and executive project, quantitative materials and three-dimensional modeling and
          renderings for presentation. I also worked with real estate regularization and
          incorporation and unfolding of land.

            In the second semester of Architecture and Urbanism, I joined the team at the

            had my first contacts with real civil construction projects. Contributes to the
            elaboration of institutional architectural projects, measurements of buildings and land,
            three-dimensional modeling, development of preliminary projects and executive

          We are a Skate organization that was born with the aim of inserting the healthy practice of this sport,
          enhancing life changes, revitalizing the space with positive actions of care and welcoming. We emerged from
          the need to change attitudes and rescue Skate Plaza's primary function, which is sport, culture and
          citizenship. Passionate about our local skateboarding scene, we seek through our work to support and
          revitalize our community by improving structures, organizing events and increasing accessibility to
          skateboarding with free lessons. Through many weeks of hard work and generous donations from the Department of
          Sports and local businesses, we were able to improve the entire Skate Plaza park and skate park in the Resedás
          neighborhood in São João da Boa Vista. Currently, with the objective of revitalizing the completed structures,
          we are directing our efforts towards free classes in the practice of the sport, with the support and
          authorization of the city hall. We have more than 30 weekly students and equipment at our disposal to donate
          complete skateboards or parts, as well as safety equipment, for students who cannot afford to buy them. Vibra
          Skate Plaza was responsible for holding two skate events in São João da Boa Vista, and also contributed to the
          holding of various activities and events related to cities in the region.

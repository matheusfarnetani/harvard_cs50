Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?:

With a small number of simulations, the results were different than with a bigger number of simulations.
The first and second simulations were less than the total amount of combinations of rounds.
Different then the higher values of N, where there is enough 'space' to the total combinations to happen once.
As the number of simulations got higher the results turned to be more refineded and the podium of "Brazil";
"Belgium": and "Spain" changed to be "Belgium"; "Brazil"; and "Portugal".

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?:

After 10000 simulations the predictions seem to be more stabilized.
After this point, the numbers don't have great changes and the result stays the same for the top 3 teams.
And it is the last value of simulations, used in the analysis, that had a time significantly lower than its next value.
